My Experience in The Flatiron School's Full Stack Developer Course


When I began this journey, I was really entering this with a clear mind, not knowing exactly the path it would lead to and reminded myself early on that this would be one of the most greuling experiences I will embark on. After all its only been about 25 years since the last time I was in college. So the fear of an old dog not learning new tricks was always an error message away. Boy was I not ready for what was to come. So what I would like to do here is make some suggestions for the non experienced new student who probably asking themselves if they can really learn the skills needed to enter the workforce.

1. Keep an open mind and TRUST the plotted course! At times you will teter on the edge of meltdown mode... it sound clique but CHILL. Learning any new language is challenging but if you stare at enough code you will eventually see things much clearer. The course will often seem chaotic, shifting from topic to topic a breakneck speed. Even learning the vernacular and all of the terminology is just as confusing but again its all about writing and looking at code! So early on stay focused.

2. Because there is so much material, don't rush for the sake of rushing, try to understand what you are writing and reading. One thing I did early on which helped was create what I call my "Master Developer's Key" which is just a spread sheet with tabs for different procedures, syntax, important terms and even some errors and how to work around them. This might seem crazy now, but with everything that is covered in this course, you will thank yourself for having access to procedures etc as needed.  

3. Learn the conventions and you have a basis for how far you can take things. Sometimes its hard to grasp how different parts of your application are intertwined, often leaving a beginner cross-eyed. Don't be afraid to break stuff. Sometimes the best way to gain an intuitive understanding of what your code is doing, is to know your code as intimately as possible. Understand why you are using helper methods. visualize what your routes are connected to. By getting a low level perspective on what youre expecting your code to do you gain a better higher level understanding of how that javascript function affects your user's experience, even if it often comes at the painful cost of breaking stuff... dont be afraid, as long as you commit early and often the world wont come to a complete halt.
  
5. HAVE FUN... I've learned to get numb to the constant barrage of error messages. Sure you can yell at your computer, you can watch a million videos, but sometimes the best way to work through an error or some other hurdle is to take a break to step outside the situation analyze what isn't working, DEBUG and take things step by step. There are a 1000 ways to get to the same destination in programming, try to keep your intentions pure and (almost verbos) and try to work out a solution that would best represent that intention. 

If you made it through the course, CONGRATS!!! What an achievment!! After all that material covered, its overwhelming to think that you can actually retain everything you learned. You may even ask yourself if there was much you retained at all... The best way to overcome this is to continue to code regularly. Putting projects together gives you the repetition you need to make all of what you learned stick. The more I do something the better I get at it, just like you or anyone else. Start projects that not only keep your head in programming mode, but to also exercise your critical thinking and problem solving skills, and to challenge yourself to create something that was if anything, a bit more complex than your last project. 

You just worked extremely hard to get the skills you need to operate the tools that will provide you many opportunities. Always add new tools by learning new frameworks and languages. Broaden your scope of expertise and again always challenge yourself. Nothing can be taken for granted in this industry and in life, so never forget to push towards a being a better version of yourself than you were yesterday and everything will come together. It never fails.
